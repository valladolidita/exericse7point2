<!--
Create an HTML document that contains a DIV with an ID attribute.

In an external CSS stylesheet, apply styles to this DIV element. Also create a CSS class that would change the appearance of the DIV when the class is applied to the DIV.

In an external JavaScript file, use an onClick handler to apply the CSS class to the DIV.

Then, try experimenting with CSS3 transitions on the property that is changed by adding the class.
